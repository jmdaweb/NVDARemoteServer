.SH NAME
NVDARemoteServer.conf \- Change NVDARemoteServer configuration
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
NVDARemoteServer.conf is the configuration file for NVDARemoteServer. On most Unix systems, it is located under /etc directory. This file has the following specifications:
.P
Blank lines are allowed. The server will ignore them.
.P
Lines starting with a # character are comments, and the server ignore them. At the moment, a comment in the same line as a setting is not allowed.
.P
Each setting goes in a line, and has the following format: option=value
.P
Spaces between option and value, before option and after value are not allowed. The server will fail and switch to default settings if it can't parse the configuration.
.P
The file has unix-style line breaks, and is encoded in UTF\-8.
.P
All options are lowercase.
.SH OPTIONS
.P
The following options are available. You can uncomment them in the file or add new lines.
.P
interface
.P
Set the ip address of the interface where the server will listen for new incoming connections. By default it listens on all available interfaces (address 0.0.0.0). In some platforms, interface setting will not work if interface6 is not configured to bind to a specific address.
.P
Example: interface=127.0.0.1
.P
interface6
.P
Set the IPV6 address of the interface where the server will listen for new incoming connections. By default it listens on all available interfaces (address ::).
.P
Example: interface6=::1
.P
port
.P
Set the server tcp port. By default it is 6837.
.P
Example: port=6838
.P
port6
.P
Listen on the specified port, but only for IPV6. By default, use the value specified in port. Use this value if you want different ports for IPV4 and IPV6 sockets.
.P
Example: port6=6838
.P
logfile
.P
Set the path of the server log file. On Unix systems, the default path is /var/log/NVDARemoteServer.log. On Windows, it's the same path as the server executable.
.P
Example: logfile=/home/john/logs/NVDARemoteServer.log
.P
pidfile
.P
When the server is running, the process id is stored in a file. Here you can set the path for that file. By default it's /var/run/NVDARemoteServer.pid
.P
If you change pidfile in the configuration file and use the server as a system daemon, update the pidfile variable in the service units for the status command to work properly.
.P
Example: pidfile=/home/john/run/NVDARemoteServer.pid
.P
loglevel
.P
Set the information that the server will write to the log. You must enter a value between 0 and 4. 0 means only errors and warnings, 1 adds connection info, 2 is used for debugging purposes, 3 adds the channel passwords, and 4 will log the protocol sent and received by the server.
.P
Warning! Do not use levels 3 and 4 on production servers, as sensitive data and the protocol sent and received by the server are included at these levels. Do not use level 4 for long running server instances, as it will quickly fill your log file with data you likely won't use. This is intended for advanced use only, and is not meant for most people to use. Most people won't need this unless they want to annalize the server's protocol or track down bugs in either the server or a client, should either be updated and cause some type of difficulty.
.P
Example: loglevel=2
.P
keyfile
.P
This setting specifies the path to a pem-encoded private key for ssl connections.
.P
The pem file must contain  the private key without passphrase encryption.
.P
This setting is optional and has no default value.
.P
Example: keyfile=/etc/apache2/ssl/privkey.pem
.P
certfile
.P
This setting specifies the path to a pem-encoded, concatenated private key and certificate for ssl connections.
.P
The pem file must contain firstly the private key without passphrase encryption, followed by an unix-style line ending and the certificate. Additional ca and root certificates can be added below this content.
.P
If the file contains only a certificate or a certificate chain, you must configure keyfile setting explained above.
.P
By default, use server.pem located in the same path as server.py.
.P
Example: certfile=/etc/apache2/ssl/certificate.pem
.P
motd
.P
This is the message displayed to all clients which join a channel. If you collect user data, this is a good place to specify an URL to your privacy policy, if available. The message must be written in a single line. Multiline support is not available yet. By default no message is displayed, unless loglevel is set to 4. In this case, clients will receive a warning message, either standalone or appended to your message.
.P
Example: motd=Hello, welcome to my relay server
.P
motd_force_display
.P
The message of the day can be displayed once (only for first-time clients) or each time a client joins a channel. Possible values for this setting: 0=False, other integer values mean True. Defaults to False (do not force display). If loglevel is set to 4, defaults to true (always display the message), and cannot be changed.
.P
Example: motd_force_display=1
.P
includeTracebacks
.P
Tracebacks are helpful when debugging exceptions, but can be quite anoying on some scenarios, such as in production servers.
.P
You can control wether tracebacks are displayed in the log file or the console using this setting.
.P
Possible values for this setting: 0=False, other integer values mean True. Defaults to False (do not display tracebacks).
.P
Example: includeTracebacks=1
.P
allowedMessageLength
.P
Some providers limit or bill outgoing server traffic. If large messages are received from a client and are relayed to all clients in the same channel, this traffic may increase significantly in a short period of time.
.P
This setting allows defining, in characters, the maximum allowed length for incoming messages.
.P
If set to 0 or lower, there is no limit
.P
 Note that characters may have different lengths depending on the Python version and encoding used.
.P
Examples:
.P
allowedMessageLength=0
.P
allowedMessageLength=10240000
