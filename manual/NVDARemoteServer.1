.SH OPTIONS
.P
NVDARemoteServer accepts some extra arguments in debug mode. The bassic syntax for them is as follows:
.P
NVDARemoteServer debug \-\-option1=value1 \-\-option2=value2 \-\-option3=value3...
.P
Currently the following options are supported:
.P
\-\-interface=ip: ip address where the server should listen. By default, listen on all available interfaces. In some platforms, interface setting will not work if interface6 is not configured to bind to a specific address.
.P
\-\-interface6=ip: IPV6 address where the server should listen. By default, listen on all available interfaces.
.P
\-\-port=port: tcp port for the server. By default 6837.
.P
\-\-port6=port: listen on the specified port, but only for IPV6. By default, use the value specified in --port. Use this value if you want different ports for IPV4 and IPV6 sockets.
.P
\-\-pidfile=/path/to/pidfile: path where the pidfile will be stored. In debug mode no pidfile is generated.
.P
\-\-logfile=/path/to/log: specify the path to the log file. In debug mode no logfile is written.
.P
\-\-configfile=/path/to/configfile: read options from the config file in the specified path. By default /etc/NVDARemoteServer.conf
.P
\-\-loglevel=n: set log level. You must provide a value between 0 and 4. Default: 2, extra information for debugging without exposing sensitive data.
.P
\-\-keyfile=path: use private key from file specified in path for ssl connections.
.P
\-\-certfile=path: use private key and certificate from file specified in path for ssl connections. If the provided pem file only contains a certificate, use also the keyfile option explained above.
.P
\-\-motd=string: specify the message of the day displayed to all clients when they join a channel. Enclose the message between quotes. A warning message will be appended to the provided string if loglevel is set to 4, or displayed alone if no message is given.
.P
\-\-motd_force_display=integer: display the message of the day even if it has not changed since last time the client joined a channel. 0 means do not force display, 1 means force display. This option is ignored when loglevel is set to 4 or above. In this case, the message is always displayed.
.P
\-\-includeTracebacks=integer: display Python tracebacks when exceptions are raised. 0 means do not display tracebacks, 1 means display tracebacks.
.P
\-\-allowedMessageLength=integer: defines maximum allowed length, in characters, for incoming client messages. 0 means no limit. Note that characters may have different lengths depending on the Python version and encoding used.
.P
\-\-timeout=float: defines the maximum time, in seconds, that a client can be connected without negotiating a SSL connection before an exception is raised.
.P
\-\-ping_time=integer: specifies the ping interval, in seconds, for all connected clients.
.SH NOTES
.P
You can change server settings by editing the configuration file. See NVDARemoteServer.conf (5) for more details. The options \-\-configfile, \-\-logfile and \-\-pidfile can affect the server in daemon mode too. Edit the service files to fit your needs.
